Defining here the layout of the program
---------------------------------------
src/main.cpp is the entrypoint, it spawns four threads: 
- Li-3 RXS recv
- Li-3 TXS recv/send
- iobc recv
Each of the Lithium-3 radios need a recv thread for listening
for responses from radio-commanding packets.
The RXS recv thread additionally will be receiving packets from the ground,
and the TXS needs an additional send thread for transmitting packets down to the ground.
Any packet or response from the radio gets passed to the main queue.
The iobc recv thread listens on the UART serial port connected to the iobc,
and either forwards any transmit-type packets intended for the ground to the TXS send queue,
or pushes it to the main queue for internal processing.
The main queue holds either command-type packets intended for processing within this program,
or are packets that are received from ground that must be forwarded to the iobc.

In summary:
-----------
radio_recv: (RXS, TXS)
packets -> main_queue

radio_send: (TXS)
for packet in send_queue: transmit packet down to ground

iobc_recv:
packets-> main_queue

main thread:
for packet in main_queue: process packet
